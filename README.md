# Jira App

A lightweight task management application inspired by Jira, enabling users to organize tasks within **Todo**, **In Progress**, and **Done** columns. The app features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, along with flexible task management options to enhance workflow efficiency.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Support**: Move tasks seamlessly between columns using JavaScript's `ondrag` and `ondrop` events, facilitating a smooth and dynamic task flow.
- **Hold & Grab Functionality**: Quickly add, edit, and manage tasks with "hold" and "grab" interactions, making task organization both flexible and user-friendly.
- **Color-Coded Columns**: Each status column is distinctly color-coded for quick recognition (e.g., **Todo** in red, **In Progress** in blue, **Done** in green).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and responsive user experience across all screen sizes.
